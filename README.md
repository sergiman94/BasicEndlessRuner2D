# 2DBasicEndlessRunnerGame

This game is developed on the Unity engine, The game is about a character running collecting coins and jumping from one
platform to another one while the character can not stop running and the camera is moving across the scene as the character
either.

## Getting Started With The Game

The game is running on the Unity engine, as we know each game developed on Unity needs to be updated depending of the
Unity version it has been created, so, when we developed  this game on version 4.6.X of unity, we are using standar assets, so the game works on any version of unity until now

### Installing

open the folder (Project) from unity, then if you see an error on any script is just because of
the sintax, there are new methods for the code you had, so, at this point they're easy to fix but if you have any problem please
contact sergiman94@gmail.com

The project has been tested


## Running the tests

For this branch the game is only for testing porpuses, so, the point of the code is to understand the functions of the inspector's
scripts, things like speed, speed milestone, coins and how many coins per platform, etc...
